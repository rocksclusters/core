# In addition to adding the roll=ROLLNAME attribute in the XML node and graph
# files we now wrap the inside of the <changelogs> as CDATA.  This means we
# can check in XML entities and '<' inside the CVS log.
#
# This is only done for Rolls, which means things like site-profile have
# to manually do this.  But, all the installed nodes/graphs will have it so
# people copying our stuff will do the right thing.

# Modified to accomadate solaris. Now PROFILE_DIR variable is mentioned
# in the top-level os-specific makefile. The reason for this is
# ordinarily /export/profile could be made relocatable. However on Solaris
# relocation of packages don't work in the same way as it does on Linux. So
# PROFILE_DIR needs to be made / on solaris.

# Ridiculously big ass commit.
# Also known as the week after thanksgiving 2006. Or "The day Anoop
# broke Rocks".
#
# Main Changes.
#
# 1. Added a roll-profile.mk file. This is meant as a makefile for building
# the profile rpm containing all the XML files meant for the roll. This is a
# breakaway from the spec.in file method of building the profile RPM.
#
# 2. The variable PWD is now changed to CURDIR. The main reason for this is
# PWD is supplied by the shell. CURDIR is the variable supplied by gmake 
# itself. This means we can have a slightly more platform independant way of 
# doing things. Also Solaris was failing to set PWD correctly in the source 
# directories, wreaking havoc on the location of the BUILD and PKG directories.
