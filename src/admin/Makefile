#
# Revision 1.20  2007/10/02 23:58:20  anoop
# Remove all references to solaris, and added references to sunos.
# This is to standardize the naming between the python scripts and
# the Makefiles. One less variable that I'll have to deal with.
#
# Revision 1.19  2007/08/14 20:07:30  anoop
# Removed cluster-kickstart-solaris.
# No need for this anymore as we just

# Revision 1.17  2007/05/30 20:47:30  anoop
# Make sure solaris utils build on solaris only. Trying to build them
# on Linux will fail
#
# Revision 1.16  2007/04/27 23:45:44  anoop
# Added the rocks-console-solaris command. This will be folded back into
# rocks console once more changes come into place
#
# Revision 1.15  2007/01/23 01:45:05  anoop
# Completed move of cluster-kickstart-solaris.c from kernel roll to base roll
#
# Revision 1.14  2006/12/06 00:20:20  anoop
# All the Makefiles get a bit of an overhaul
#
# $(INSTALL) is used instead of install
# $(MAKE) is used instead of make or gmake
# $(TAR) is used instead of tar of gtar
#
# The mode argument for the $(INSTALL) command needs to be numeric and
# follow the convention of
#
# install [-cs] [-g group] [-m mode] [-o owner] file ...  destination
# install  -d   [-g group] [-m mode] [-o owner] dir
#
# This is portable across solaris and linux.
#
# Finally "tar xzf $TARFILE.tar.gz" is replaced with "gunzip -c $TARFILE.tar.gz | tar -xf -"
# This is again done for portability.
#
# This needs to be the convention from now on.
#
# Revision 1.13  2006/12/02 01:04:53  anoop
# Ridiculously big ass commit.
# Also known as the week after thanksgiving 2006. Or "The day Anoop
# broke Rocks".
#
# Main Changes.
#
# 1. Added a roll-profile.mk file. This is meant as a makefile for building
# the profile rpm containing all the XML files meant for the roll. This is a
# breakaway from the spec.in file method of building the profile RPM.
#
# 2. The variable PWD is now changed to CURDIR. The main reason for this is
# PWD is supplied by the shell. CURDIR is the variable supplied by gmake itself.
# This means we can have a slightly more platform independant way of doing things.
# Also Solaris was failing to set PWD correctly in the source directories, wreaking
# havoc on the location of the BUILD and PKG directories.
